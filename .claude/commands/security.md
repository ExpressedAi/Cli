**SECURITY ANALYSIS MODE** 🛡️

Run comprehensive security analysis using specialized security neurons:

## Red Team Phase 🔴

Activate **RedTeamerNeuron** to find vulnerabilities:

### Attack Vectors to Explore
- Input validation bypasses
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, Command, etc.)
- Business logic flaws
- Race conditions and TOCTOU
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Configuration issues
- Information disclosure
- Privilege escalation paths

### Red Team Operations
- **Operations**: Refute, Negate, Escalate, Discriminate
- **Focus**: Find edge cases, boundary conditions, unexpected inputs
- **Mindset**: Adversarial - how would an attacker exploit this?

## Blue Team Phase 🔵

Activate **BlueTeamerNeuron** to design defenses:

### Defense Strategies
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure authentication patterns
- Authorization models (RBAC, ABAC)
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege principle
- Security headers and CSP
- Rate limiting and DoS protection
- Logging and monitoring
- Incident response procedures

### Blue Team Operations
- **Operations**: Harmonize, Integrate, Align, Execute
- **Focus**: Comprehensive defense, layered security
- **Mindset**: Protective - how do we prevent, detect, and respond?

## Quantum Enhancement

- **Memory Navigation**: Retrieve known CVEs and attack patterns
- **COPL Learning**: Apply patterns from successful security implementations
- **PPQ Introspection**: Validate security claims with high certainty
- **Wormhole Navigation**: Find analogous security issues in similar systems

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Vulnerability Report** (Red Team findings)
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Impact analysis
   - Proof of concept
   - CVSS score if applicable

2. **Mitigation Plan** (Blue Team recommendations)
   - Immediate fixes
   - Long-term improvements
   - Security controls to implement
   - Monitoring and detection

3. **Security Posture Assessment**
   - Overall risk level
   - Top priorities
   - Residual risks after mitigations

Be thorough, specific, and actionable in security recommendations.
