**NEURON NETWORK** activation 🧠

## Available Neurons

### Memory & Knowledge
- **Archivist** - Store information in Superarray memory
- **Librarian** - Organize and categorize knowledge
- **Historian** - Validate truth and check sources

### Analysis & Reasoning
- **Orchestrator** - Main reasoning and harmonization
- **Strategist** - Multi-option planning and decision trees
- **Appraiser** - Evaluate ideas and solutions

### Creation & Innovation
- **Muse** - Generate novel creative ideas
- **Forge** - Build and manifest artifacts
- **Simulator** - Create digital twins and models

### Quality & Safety
- **Auditor** - Validate contracts and requirements
- **Watcher** - Monitor for safety violations
- **Benchmarker** - Measure and compare performance

### Security
- **Red Teamer** - Find vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- **Blue Teamer** - Design defenses and mitigations

### Operations
- **Conductor** - Manage live operations and coordination

## Cognitive Operations

Each neuron can perform specific operations:

**Generation**: Innovate, Propose, Manifest, Execute, Actualize
**Analysis**: Interpret, Evaluate, Compare, Contrast, Discriminate, Benchmark
**Memory**: Store, Recall, Evoke, Resonate, Transform
**Integration**: Harmonize, Integrate, Unify, Align, Embed, Implant
**Refinement**: Attune, Filter, Amplify
**Critical**: Refute, Negate, Escalate
**Decision**: Select, Modify

## Usage

Specify which neurons or operations you need:

Examples:
- "Activate Muse and Forge to design a new feature"
- "Use Red Teamer to find security issues"
- "Activate Historian to validate these claims"
- "Use Strategist for multi-path planning"

I'll activate the appropriate neurons and show their processing results.
