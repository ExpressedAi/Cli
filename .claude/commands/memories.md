**QUANTUM MEMORY EXPLORER** 💾

Explore and manage your persistent memory across sessions:

## Memory Categories

- **pattern**: Recurring patterns discovered through quantum analysis
- **insight**: Key insights and discoveries
- **learning**: What the system has learned from past work
- **strategy**: Successful strategies and approaches
- **neuron_activation**: Records of effective neuron combinations
- **wormhole_path**: Discovered memory navigation paths
- **ppq_finding**: PPQ introspection findings

## Available Commands

### View All Memories
Use `view_memory` to see what's stored

### Search Memories
Use `search_memories` with a query to find relevant past insights

### Store New Memory
Use `store_quantum_insight` to save a discovery

### Categories
Ask me to show memories by category (pattern, insight, learning, etc.)

## Example Queries

- "Show me all stored patterns"
- "Search memories for authentication insights"
- "What have we learned about React optimization?"
- "Store this discovery about quantum wormholes"

## Memory Structure

Each memory includes:
- Title and category
- Timestamp
- Full content
- Metadata (confidence, neurons used, VBC phase)

Your memories build over time - each session adds to your knowledge base!

Let me help you explore your quantum memories.
