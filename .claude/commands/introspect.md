description: "Deep introspection using PPQ (Post-Processing Query) engine"
---

Run **PPQ INTROSPECTION** on the last response 🔍

Use the Post-Processing Query engine to deeply analyze the previous response with all 14 analytical lenses:

## Analytical Lenses to Apply

1. **Sentiment Analysis** - Emotional tone and affect trajectory
2. **Bias Monitor** - Detect assumptions and framing effects
3. **Source Provenance** - Trace reasoning chain and knowledge sources
4. **Reveal Reasoning** - Expose logical structure and inference steps
5. **Strategic Intent** - Identify high-level goals and sub-goals
6. **Subtext Scanner** - Surface hidden implications
7. **Value Alignment** - Check alignment with user values
8. **Uncertainty Quantification** - Measure confidence and epistemic status
9. **Dimension Trace** - Which Superarray dimensions activated
10. **COPL Pattern Analysis** - Which phase-lock patterns were used
11. **VBC Budget Analysis** - How semantic resources were allocated
12. **Coherence Check** - Internal consistency validation
13. **Novelty Assessment** - Originality vs. pattern reuse
14. **Actionability Extraction** - Concrete next steps

## Output Format

Provide a comprehensive PPQ report showing:
- Overall score (0-1)
- Findings from each lens
- Flags and warnings
- Confidence in analysis
- Training data insights (why these memories, why this response)

Make the introspection transparent and actionable.
