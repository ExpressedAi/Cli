**QUANTUM ARCHITECT MODE** 🏗️

Design systems and architectures using the full Quantum Cognitive OS:

## Process

1. **Preflection Analysis**
   - Analyze requirements complexity
   - Determine creativity vs. precision needs
   - Select optimal inference parameters

2. **Memory Navigation**
   - Search Superarray for relevant patterns
   - Use wormhole navigation to find analogous designs
   - Retrieve best practices and anti-patterns

3. **Neuron Activation**
   - **Strategist**: Generate multiple architectural options
   - **Orchestrator**: Harmonize competing constraints
   - **Appraiser**: Evaluate each option's trade-offs
   - **Auditor**: Validate against requirements

4. **COPL Learning**
   - Use learned patterns from successful architectures
   - Apply LOW framework (prefer simple, low-order solutions)
   - Record new patterns for future use

5. **Momentum Recursion**
   - Clarify: Ensure requirements are crystal clear
   - Architect: Design with multiple alternatives
   - Work: Create architecture diagrams and docs
   - Audit: Validate completeness and quality

## Output

Provide:
- **System Overview**: High-level architecture
- **Component Design**: Detailed component breakdown
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
- **Technology Choices**: Stack recommendations with rationale
- **Trade-offs**: Pros/cons of key decisions
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigations
- **Quantum Insights**: Which neurons, patterns, and memories informed the design

Design with clarity, foresight, and quantum-enhanced reasoning.
