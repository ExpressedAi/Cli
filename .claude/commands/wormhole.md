Engage **WORMHOLE NAVIGATION** mode 🌀

Explore the memory graph using non-linear wormhole traversal to discover unexpected connections.

## Navigation Strategies Available

Choose one or let me select based on the query:

- **breadth_first**: Explore broadly, discover many related concepts
- **depth_first**: Go deep quickly, follow threads to their end
- **best_first**: Follow the strongest connections
- **random_walk**: Stochastic exploration for serendipity
- **guided**: Use spin vector to navigate toward specific dimensions
- **surprise**: Seek unexpected, novel connections
- **temporal**: Follow time sequences
- **causal**: Follow cause-effect chains

## Wormhole Types

The system creates wormholes based on:
- **Semantic** similarity
- **Temporal** proximity
- **Causal** relationships
- **Entity** connections
- **Pattern** recognition
- **Contrast** and opposition
- **Analogy** leaps
- **Hierarchical** parent-child
- **Surprise** unexpectedness
- **Resonance** harmonic patterns

## Your Task

1. Select navigation strategy based on user's needs
2. Navigate through memory using wormholes
3. Report interesting paths discovered
4. Highlight surprising connections (unexpectedness score > 0.7)
5. Show how the navigation enriched the response

Make the journey through the knowledge graph visible and insightful.
