**QUANTUM WEB RESEARCH MODE** 🔬

Perform comprehensive research combining web search, quantum analysis, and persistent memory:

## What This Does

1. **Search the Web**: Find current, authoritative sources on your topic
2. **Quantum Analysis**: Process findings through the Quantum Cognitive OS
3. **Store Insights**: Save discoveries to persistent memory for future sessions
4. **Synthesize**: Generate comprehensive analysis with citations

## How to Use

Just specify your research topic:
- "Latest developments in quantum computing"
- "Best practices for React 19"
- "Security vulnerabilities in Node.js 22"

## The System Will:

1. Use `quantum_web_research` to gather sources
2. Process each source with `quantum_process` for deep analysis
3. Store key insights with `store_quantum_insight`
4. Generate a comprehensive report with citations

## Output Includes:

- Source citations (always!)
- Quantum cognitive analysis
- Confidence scores and metadata
- Stored memory references

## Remember:
- Research is saved to memory for future reference
- Use `/memories` to view past research
- Combine with `/momentum` for iterative deep-dives

Let's research your topic with quantum precision!
